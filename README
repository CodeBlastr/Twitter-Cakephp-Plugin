CakePHP TwitterComponent
 
This is an easy component for CakePHP to handle with the Twitter API. It includes also 
the authorization via OAuth and the CakePHP HttpSocket, allowd trough the 'http_socket_oauth' by 
Neil Crookes <www.neilcrookes.com>. 
With this component you can easely call the main Twitter API methods, such as status updates, users
or timelines, in your controllers when your application is authorized.
Before you start visit https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new and register your own app to get your
OAuthConsumer and OAuthConsumerSecret. Then you are able to start and connect your CakePHP-App
with twitter.
